# Pc-Parts_Picker

the core purpose of this project is to bring a bit of light on the interactiveness that can be acomplish in JavaScript even with the simplest tools such as the "map area".

My script is called "script.js" located in the "js" folder, it's commented for better understanding.

The 'stylesheet' is called like that and it's located in the "css" folder (it contains great part of the popup behavior).
